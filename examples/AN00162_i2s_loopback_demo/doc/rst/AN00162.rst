Overview
--------

Introduction
............

The XMOS |i2s| library provides software defined, industry-standard,
|i2s| (Integrated Interchip Sound) components that allows you to
stream audio between devices using xCORE GPIO ports.

|i2s| is a specific type of PCM digital audio communication using
a bit clock line, word clock line and at least one multiplexed data line.

The library includes features such as |i2s| master, |i2s| slave,
and TDM master components. This application note uses the
library to create an |i2s| master digital loopback.

   Application block diagram

The application fits entirely within one logical core. The |i2s|, GPIO,
and I\ :sup:`2`\ C drivers are all time-multiplexed with the loopback application.


|i2s| loopback demo
-------------------

The Makefile
............

To start using the |i2s|, you need to add ``lib_i2s`` to you Makefile::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_i2s ...

This demo also uses the I\ :sup:`2`\ C library (``lib_i2c``) and the GPIO library
(``lib_gpio``). The I\ :sup:`2`\ C library is used to configure the
audio codecs. The GPIO library abstracts the use of a 4-bit port to
drive four individual reset and select lines. So the Makefile also
includes::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_gpio lib_i2c ..


Includes
........

All XC files which declare the application ``main()`` function need
to include ``platform.h``. XMOS xCORE specific defines for declaring
and initialising hardware are defined in ``xs1.h``.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: include <platform.h>
   :end-on: include <xs1.h>

The |i2s| library functions are defined in ``i2s.h``. This header must
be included in your code to use the library.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: include <i2s.h>
   :end-on: include <gpio.h>

The other two includes give access to the I\ :sup:`2`\ C and GPIO library functions
which this application note relies on.


Allocating hardware resources
.............................

An |i2s| interface requires both clock and data pins in order to
communicate with the audio codec device. On an xCORE
the pins are controlled by ``ports``. The ports used by the |i2s|
library are declared on the tile they reside and with their
direction and buffered nature. This loopback application uses
four 1-bit ports for input and four more for output:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: out buffered port:32 p_lrclk
   :end-on: in buffered port:32 p_din

The xCORE also provides ``clock block`` hardware to efficiently generate
clock singal that can either be driven out on a port or used
to control a port. In this application two clocks blocks are used:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: clock mclk
   :end-on: clock bclk

The other ports declared are used by the I\ :sup:`2`\ C library to configure
the audio codecs and by the application to control reset and
chip select:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: port p_i2c
   :end-on: port p_gpio

The application main() function
...............................

The ``main()`` function in the program sets up the tasks in the application.

Firstly, the ``interfaces`` are declared. In XC interfaces provide a
means of concurrent tasks communicating with each other. In this
application there is an interface for the |i2s| master, an interface
for the I\ :sup:`2`\ C master and one for the GPIO output.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: interface i2s
   :end-on: interface output

The rest of the ``main`` function starts all the tasks in parallel
using the XC ``par`` construct:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: par {
   :end-before: return 0

This code starts the |i2s| master, the I\ :sup:`2`\ C master, the GPIO control
and the loopback application.

Before the |i2s| master runs, the system configuration is run and the
master clock is connected from the input port to the clock block and
then started. The |i2s| master task then starts and consumes a logical
core on the xCORE device.

The remaining tasks in the ``par`` are marked with the
``[[distribute]]`` attribute. This means they will run on an existing
logical core if possible. In this case they will all share the
one logical core with the |i2s| master so this entire application
requires only one core.

Configuring audio codecs
........................

Two audio codecs are used on the xCORE-200 MC AUDIO board. A Cirrus
CS5368 for audio input and a Cirrus CS4384 for audio output. These
codecs have to be configured before they can be used. The
``reset_codecs()`` function writes to the appropriate codec registers
to configure them:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: void reset_codecs
   :end-before: [[distributable]]

If porting this application to a different xCORE development board
then this is the function that will have to be modified to configure
the relevant codecs for that board.

|newpage|

The i2s_loopback application
............................

The |i2s| loopback task provides the function of a digital loopback
so that all |i2s| samples received by the device will be forwarded on.

The task itself is declared as a ``[[distributable]]`` function
ensuring that it can share a logical core with other tasks. This
is an XC feature of any task that is of the form::

  ...
  while(1) {
    select {
      ...
    }
  }

The function takes a number of arguments:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: [[distributable]]
   :end-on: mclk_select

The interface to the |i2s| master is a callback interface that the
|i2s| master will call over when it has received data or is ready to
send data.

The I\ :sup:`2`\ C interface is used to configure the codecs and the GPIO
interfaces abstract the outputting of single-bit values on a multi-bit
port.

|newpage|

The body of the loopback task handles the |i2s| interface calls:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: int32_t samples
   :end-before: static char

The |i2s| master library calls the ``init()`` method before it starts
any data streaming. This allows the application to reset and configure
the audio codecs.

The ``receive()`` interface method is called when the master has
received an audio sample on the channel specified by ``index``. The sample
is stored in the ``samples`` array.

The ``send()`` interface method is called when the master needs a new
sample to send on the specified channel. The ``->`` symbol shows
the return value expected from this call. In this case the application
simply returns the current sample on that channel.

Finally, the ``restart_check()`` method is called by the |i2s| master
once per frame and allows the application to control restart or
shutdown of the |i2s| master. In this case the application continues to
run forever and so always returns ``I2S_NO_RESTART``.

Demo hardware setup
-------------------

The demo is designed to run on the xCORE-200 MC Audio board. To run the
demo:

 * Connect the XTAG-2 or XTAG-3 USB debug adapter to the xCORE-200 MC AUDIO board.
 * Connect the XTAG-2 or XTAG-3 to the host PC using USB extension cable.
 * Connect a sound source to the 3.5mm line in. Channels 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 or 7-8 can be used.
 * Connect headphones or speakers to the corresponding line out.
 * Connect the 12V power adaptor to the xCORE-200 MC AUDIO board.

Launching the demo device
-------------------------

Once the application source code is imported into the tools it can
be built by pressing the :menuitem:`Build` button in the
xTIMEcomposer. This will create the ``AN00162_i2s_loopback_demo.xe``
binary in the ``bin`` folder of the project. xTIMEcomposer may
have to import the dependent libraries if you do not already have them
in your workspace; this will occur automatically on build.

A *Run Configuration* then needs to be set up. This can be done by
selecting the :menuitem:`Run,Run Configurations...` menu. You can
create a new run configuration by right clicking on the
:menuitem:`xCORE application` group in the left hand pane and
:menuitem:`New`.

Select your XMOS XTAG in the Target box and click **Apply**. You can
now click the **Run** button to launch the application.

The audio from the input should now be playing on the corresponding output channel.
All 8 channels should be active.

Alternatively, the command line tools can be used to build and run the application.
Building is done by changing to the folder containing the ``src`` sub-folder and
doing a call to ``xmake``. Running the application is then done using
``xrun bin/AN00162_i2s_loopback_demo.xe``.
